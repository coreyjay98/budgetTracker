## Project Description

This project is a Progressive Web App that has been set up to work online and offline, the app will store offline requests through the use of service workers and also output a live version of the calculated account balance

### Installation

I have hosted this app through Heroku and so instead of hosting it yourself, you can view the app I have created through this link here !
